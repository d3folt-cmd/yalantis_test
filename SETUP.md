In file create.py run method create() that contains several methods:
create.db() - method from create_database.py that creates tables empty 'driver' and 'vehicle'.
clear.db() - method from create_database.py clears all data from tables so it is easier to create tables with new data again.
adddata() - method from add_data.py that fills tables with data you write here.
displaydata() - display tables in console.

Run app.py to run the project.

After running app.py you can run test.py where are two simple test methods - first add driver and second print his id.
